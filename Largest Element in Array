Given an array arr[]. The task is to find the largest element and return it.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 8, 7, 56, 90]
Output: 90
Explanation: The largest element of the given array is 90.
Input: arr[] = [5, 5, 5, 5]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest element of the given array is 5.
Input: arr[] = [10]
Output: 10
Explanation: There is only one element which is the largest.

Soln:

Time Complexity:O(N)
Space complexity :O(1)

class Solution {
  public:
    int largest(vector<int> &arr) {
      int i,big=arr[0];
      for(i=1;i<arr.size();i++){
          if(big<arr[i])
            big=arr[i];
      }
      return big;
    }
};
